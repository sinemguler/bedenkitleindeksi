**Body Mass Index**

***The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.***
